# Live Image Prediction
This App is made by [Junaid](https://abujuni.dev) and [and](https://apps.abujuni.dev).

This app helps you to communicate with your Api or you can take this as a Api testing template.

Here , I am doing it with My Python Flask Api project -> [Alphabet Recognition Api](https://github.com/junaidcodingmaster/Alphabet-Recognition-Api), this api is a `AI` , which can take a image and return all words is shown in image (I take a to z alphabets image and send it !) to a `string format` , It also have `base64 decoder` to decode base64 data to a image. Ex - In this app `Image -> base64 + apiKey + userUID + addAnyletter(1,100,"0000","0001") -> nv5fv54bfb...` , In Api - `value = givenData.replace(removeAnyLetter(0,101,"0000","0001"),removeAnyLetter(0,101,"0000","0001") +  value.replace(getUID(encodeUID()),"") + value.replace(getApiKey((encodeapikey()))) -> base64`.
